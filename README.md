# flow diagram for Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

![Nestjs Github action Deployment cicd](https://github.com/VyankateshwarTaikar/NestJS_HelloWorld_app/assets/102132721/b7799f63-48b5-45d2-a857-33480d2ca986)

## GitHub Actions Workflow (Deploy.yml):

1. Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch.
2. Checkout the code.
3. Set up Node.js environment.
4. Install dependencies.
5. Build the application.
6. Decode and set up the SSH key.
7. Deploy to EC2.

# ðŸŒŸExplanation of Secrets 
1.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64: Base64 encoded SSH private key.(that you got while you creating Ec2 instance )

2.EC2_HOST: The EC2 instance's public IP or hostname.

3.EC2_USER: The SSH user for the EC2 instance, typically ubuntu for Ubuntu AMIs.


# ðŸŒ Trigger Workflow:
The workflow is triggered when there is a push to the main branch.

## Checkout Code:
Uses the actions/checkout@v2 action to clone the repository.

## Set Up Node.js:
Uses the actions/setup-node@v3 action to set up Node.js version 18.

## Install Dependencies:
Runs npm install to install the necessary Node.js dependencies.

## Build Next.js App:

Runs npm run build to build the Next.js application.

## Decode and Set Up SSH Key:

Decodes the SSH private key from the GitHub secret and adds it to the ssh-agent for authentication with the EC2 instance.

## Deploy to EC2:

Connects to the EC2 instance using SSH and runs the deployment commands.

# ðŸ‘‰ when you Update Deploy.yml that will automatically run the deployment
